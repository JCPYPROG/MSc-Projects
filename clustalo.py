# Set this variable to the location of your clustal executable, in my case
# I run clustal by just typing 'clustalo' in the terminal, but if your on 
# windows, you may need to set this to the location of your executable e.g.
# r"D:\Affimer_project\clustal-omega-1.2.2-win64\clustalo.exe". Here the r is
# needed so that it is read as a raw string
exe = 'clustalo'
